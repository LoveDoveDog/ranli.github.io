abstract: "This paper studies the joint device selection and power control for wireless federated learning (FL), considering both the analog downlink and over-the-air computation (AirComp)-based uplink communications between the parameter server (PS) and the terminal devices. First, we propose an AirComp-based adaptive reweighing scheme for the aggregation of local updated models, where the model aggregation weights are directly determined by the uplink transmit power values of the selected devices. Furthermore, we provide a convergence analysis for the proposed wireless FL algorithm and derive the upper bound on the expected optimality gap between the expected and optimal global loss values with respect to (w.r.t.) the selected devices and downlink and uplink transmit power values. With instantaneous channel state information (CSI), we formulate the optimality gap minimization problem, which is solved by using the semidefinite programming (SDR) technique. Numerical results reveal that our proposed wireless FL algorithm achieves close to the best performance by using the ideal FedAvg scheme with error-free model exchange and full device participation."
